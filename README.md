# Speech-Signals-Classification-with-Random-Convolution-Kernels

UWO project

Supervisor: Hojjat Salehinejad, Vijay Parsa

Project Description: Rocket [1] is a fast and accurate time series classification method which uses thousands of randomly generated convolutional kernels to transform time series, without training the kernels, and classifies the extracted features with a simple
classifier. In this project, Rocket will be implemented and evaluated for speech signals classification. The datasets will be AudioMNIST, ANAD, and BAVED [2].
